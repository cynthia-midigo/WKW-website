    'Wanawake kwa wanawake in Kenya is an Australian Not for Profit Charity that was started in 2004 by Marguerite Ryan.  Wanawake kwa wanawake in Kenya  is managed entirely by its board of directors and volunteers, and is intensely proud of its Australian heritage in helping the people of Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya.Wanawake kwa wanawake in Kenya  has evolved from its initial starting point of helping women, to a more dominant purpose of helping to educate children from Kibera who otherwise would not have any schooling, in order to relieve poverty and to provide families with necessities for life.',

    description:
    'The driving force behind the charity is Marguerite Ryan  an Australian who for years worked hard to fund-raise for various projects in Kenya and Tanzania as a development officer for The Christian Brothers.Marguerite was made a “Member of the General Division of the Order of Australia” in the 2013 Queen’s Birthday Awards in recognition of her work in Africa and in 2007 was a finalist in the Victoria section of “Australian of the year”.It was on her travels to Kenya with Brother Frank Chappell that they often visited the slum of Kibera.  Appalled at what she saw, and with the full support of Frank, Marguerite rose to the challenge.  On returning to Australia, Marguerite enlisted the support of friends to do fundraising. After a poignant article in the Age newspaper, she was flooded with offers of support. Many of these supporters are still actively engaged as fundraisers, sponsors and donors.',
